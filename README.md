## Grading Rubric Requirement

Comments are placed within the code above the area where the element is implemented.
These take the form e.g. `<!-- GR 1.4 -->` or `//GR 1.4` which corresponds to the page and row in the Grading Rubric document.

## Development server

Download the files, run `npm i` then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
